# Huffman Coding in C++

This project demonstrates **Huffman Coding**, a lossless data compression algorithm implemented in C++. The program builds a Huffman Tree from input text, generates corresponding Huffman codes for each character, encodes the text, and then decodes it back to verify correctness.

## 💡 Features

- Builds a frequency map of characters
- Constructs a Huffman Tree using a custom Min-Heap
- Generates binary codes for each character
- Encodes the original text into a binary string
- Decodes the binary string back into the original text

## 🧠 Algorithm Used

- **Huffman Coding** for compression
- **Min-Heap (custom implementation)** for building the tree

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: C++
- STL: `unordered_map`, `string`


## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aishnagupta31/Huffman-Encoding.git
   cd Huffman-Encoding
2. Compile the code:  g++ HuffmanEncoding.cpp -o HuffmanEncoding
3. Run the executable: ./HuffmanEncoding
